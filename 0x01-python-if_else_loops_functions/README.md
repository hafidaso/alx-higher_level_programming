## Files

The following are the files required for this project:

- 0-positive_or_negative.py: Python script that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
- 1-last_digit.py: Python script that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and checks if it is greater than 5, is 0, or is less than 6 and not 0.
- 2-print_alphabet.py: Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- 3-print_alphabt.py: Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- 4-print_hexa.py: Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.
