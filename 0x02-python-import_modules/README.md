## Tasks

0. Import a Simple Function

- In this task, a program is created that imports the add function from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.

The program assigns the value 1 to a variable called a and the value 2 to a variable called b.
The add function is imported only once using the from add_0 import add statement.
The program prints the addition result using the print function with string formatting.

1. My First Toolbox!

- In this task, a program is created that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, performs various mathematical operations, and prints the results.

The program assigns the value 10 to a variable a and the value 5 to a variable b.
The imported functions add, sub, mul, and div are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
The program prints the results of each operation using the print function with string formatting.

2. How to Make a Script Dynamic!

- This task involves creating a program that prints the number and list of command-line arguments.

The program uses the len(argv) function to get the number of command-line arguments.
If there are no arguments, it prints "0 arguments."
If there is at least one argument, it prints the number of arguments followed by a new line.
For each argument, it prints the position and value in the format position: value.

3. Infinite Addition

- The task is to create a program that prints the result of adding all the command-line arguments.

The program casts the arguments into integers using the int() function.
It calculates the sum of all the integer arguments and prints the result.

4. Who Are You?

- In this task, a program is created that prints all the names defined in the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.

The program reads and analyzes the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.
It prints one name per line, in alphabetical order, excluding names that start with double underscores.

5. Everything Can Be Imported

- The task is to create a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

- The program imports the variable a from the file using the correct import statement.
- It prints the value of a using the print function.


## Usage

To run the programs for each task, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the desired script using the command: ./script.py.+
