## About
ALX Web jQuery is a comprehensive exploration of the jQuery library, a JavaScript tool created to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal, manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) interactions in web development. Developed by John Resig in 2006, jQuery has evolved into one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries among web developers. This project delves deep into jQuery, providing insights into its usage for the mentioned functionalities and beyond. Overall, jQuery proves to be a powerful and extensively employed tool in web development, streamlining the process of building interactive web applications.
